# Simple Calculator

This project is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes basic arithmetic functions such as addidion, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I also made it look like your usual calculator as a fun little challenge for myself. Like my other designs, I use a white and pink color scheme.
